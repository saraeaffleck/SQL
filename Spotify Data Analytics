# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#First I determined the top 5 songs
SELECT track_name as Track, artist_name as Artist, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
Limit 5;

#Next I determined the 5 least popular songs 
SELECT track_name as Track, artist_name as Artist, Popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity asc
Limit 5;


#Then I determined what songs have the highest 'Danceability' and 'Enegry'
SELECT track_name as Track, artist_name as Artist, avg(danceability) as Danceability,avg(energy) as Enegry
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
Limit 5;

#Lastly I determined who  the top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;
